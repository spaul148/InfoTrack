# InfoTrack
Web Scraper - A project to scrap google search engine to get results based on keyword searches. 

A user can set a limit on the search and can pass in a keyword to search. The results can be further refined using a sub search within those google search results.

The result is a grid display on the screen with results that include Rank Order, where the search was found in and brief snippet of the searched text.
